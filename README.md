# BON VOYAGE GAME
## Team: The Venusians

### Our Challenge

Our challenge was to help people become more aware of the risks of space travel and what NASA's doing to reduce those risks.

### What We Did

Format: Analog

We created a game in which the player goes out to space and he is at the start vunerable to all the risks of space travel.

The player must conquer challenges to move ahead so he can evolve, each evolution rewards the player with a super power which provides him immunity against a certain stressor.

The first player to reach all 10 evolutions wins.

Using trivia questions and info drops the player learn about interesting infomation and NASA's efforts.

### Rules of the game

The player starts with evolution 0 and finishes at evolution level 10.


While on the path to evolution there are many hurdles and plus points too, let's see what they are:

One of which is UFO Rendezvous, Whoever lands on this tile has to answer a question card, whoever clears it is free to jump 2 tiles forward, and if it goes wrong he moves 2 tiles backward!

The 2nd special tile is Asteroid Hit, if the player lands on an asteroid hit he is taken back to the nearest UFO Rendezvous tile and the player has to answer another tough question

The 3rd tile is Deserted planet whoever lands on a deserted planet has to skip its next dice roll which makes him 1 step behind the other players!

The 4th tile is Refuel, who ever lands on this tile goes directly to evolution.

The 5th tile is the blackhole, if you land here you are sucked back to You Met An Alien

The 6th is You Met An Alien, here you test your luck. Here you get 5 options:

- You can get de-evolutionized, You're down a level now
- Direct to Refuel which takes you directly to the evolution
- The next time you land on an asteroid hit it won't hit you!
- Next time You find a deserted planet you won't lose your next turn
- You will directly go to evolution
- Move some steps ahead

In the end, the player gets immune to all kinds of stressors and is all good to go to Mars!
