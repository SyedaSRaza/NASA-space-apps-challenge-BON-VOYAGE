# BON VOYAGE GAME
## Team: The Venusians

### Introduction

This game is designed to explore space, face the challenges, and how a player evolves after facing each challenge.

### Rules of the game

The player starts with evolution 0 and finishes at evolution level 10.


While on the path to evolution there are many hurdles and plus points too, let's see what they are:

One of which is Trivia, Whoever lands on Trivia has to answer a question card related to the reasons and cure of the stressors, and whoever clears it is free to jump 2 tiles forward, and if it goes wrong he moves 2 tiles backward!

The 2nd special tile is Asteroid Hit, if the player lands on an asteroid hit it hits back to trivia and the player has to answer another tough question, the 3rd tile is Deserted planet whoever lands on a deserted planet has to skip its next dice roll which makes him 1 step behind the other players!

Another test your  luck place is the one where you meet an alien and test your luck, here you get 5 options:

You can get de-evolutionized
Direct to Refuel which takes you directly to the evolution
The next time you land on an asteroid hit it won't hit you!
Next time You find a deserted planet you won't lose your next turn
you will directly go to  evolution
Well, the next tile is a black hole if you go there you will fall and reach you met an alien tile.

In the end, the player gets immune to all kinds of stressors and is all good to go to Mars!
